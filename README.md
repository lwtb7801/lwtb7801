### I love machine learning and data science! During my Master's in Health Informatics, I developed a strong interest in artificial intelligence, software engineering and their applications in healthcare. I am passionate about using data science to solve real-world problems and therefore I keep studying on programming, cloud computing and machine learning. I am eager to contribute my skills to a team focused on developing innovative solutions using machine learning and data science.
